# Coding Agent Guide

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI (one-time):
```bash
uv tool install google-agents-cli
```

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements
Before writing any code, understand the project's requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

### Phase 2: Build and Implement
Implement agent logic in `app/`. Use `agents-cli playground` for interactive testing. Iterate based on user feedback.

### Phase 3: The Evaluation Loop (Main Iteration Phase)
Start with 1-2 eval cases, run `agents-cli eval run`, iterate. Expect 5-10+ iterations. See the **Evaluation Guide** for metrics, evalset schema, LLM-as-judge config, and common gotchas.

### Phase 4: Pre-Deployment Tests
Run `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration`. Fix issues until all tests pass.

### Phase 5: Deploy to Dev
**Requires explicit human approval.** Run `agents-cli deploy` only after user confirms. See the **Deployment Guide** for details.

### Phase 6: Production Deployment
Ask the user: Option A (simple single-project) or Option B (full CI/CD pipeline with `agents-cli infra cicd`).

## Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `agents-cli playground` | Interactive local testing |
| `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration` | Run unit and integration tests |
| `agents-cli eval run` | Run evaluation against evalsets |
| `agents-cli lint` | Check code quality |
| `agents-cli infra single-project` | Set up project infrastructure (Terraform) |
| `agents-cli deploy` | Deploy to dev |
| `agents-cli scaffold enhance` | Add deployment target or CI/CD to project |
| `agents-cli scaffold upgrade` | Upgrade project to latest version |

- **Project Model**: The current model is **gemini-3.1-flash-lite**. Do NOT change this unless requested.
- **Multimodal Workflow**: This agent handles image uploads. When testing in the playground or via API, ensure the `parts` include both `text` and `inline_data` for images.
- **Paralympic Parity**: Always maintain parity in responses. If modifying the system instruction, preserve the "Paralympic Clause".
- **BigQuery Mocking**: Set `MOCK_BIGQUERY=True` in `.env` for local testing without live GCP credentials.
- **Deployment**: Use `gcloud run deploy` as it's configured for the multi-stage build (React + FastAPI).
